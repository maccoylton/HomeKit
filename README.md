# HomeKit for Bluetooth (BLE)

Forked from aanon4/HomeKit. 

Apple's HomeKit protocol supports both IP and BLE devices. While there appear to be a few open source implementations
of IP stacks around (notably https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS), I couldn't find any BLE stacks. So, here's one for
you to play with.

This stack runs on the Nordic BLE nRF51 series of chips. The projects compiles using the "standard" Eclipse/GCC toolchain
setup.

# NOTE

**This code hasn't been updated in a long time, and it's been drawn to my attention that Apple's newer BLE spec for HomeKit is vastly different to this version.**

I'm looking at what it takes to update to the latest Relase 1 Apple specs, protocol version 02.01.00 for now this wil compile and you can pair from a IOS 11 device. (IOS 12 gives a domain error).  You must use the NRF51 SDK version 9. It doesn't compile with other versions.

To get going download and install Eclipse. Use the Eclipse importÂ function to import this code straight from github. You also need to download the NRF51 SDK veriosn 9, copy it into the eclipse workspace directory and then in eclipse use the import wizard to import from file system.  

# Code

The code provides all the services required to pair iOS with a BLE device and to operate that device once paired. It
runs on the Nordic nRF51 PCA10028 development board.

## Timings

Here are some perliminary timings. Note that most of the crypto code is in C but with some assembly used to speed the 256-bit integer multiplies. Also note that these timings do not include the time to send and receive payloads. But, anyway, numbers:

### nRF51

#### Pairing

Pairing is dominated by the SRP algorithm which is very slow and expensive. Fortunately this only happens once when the iOS device is being associated with the HomeKit device:

Time: 40 seconds

#### Verify

Verify happens everytime an iOS device reconnected to the HomeKit device. Ideally this should be as fast as possible. I've included the C-only and assembly timings here - the difference is dramatic:

Time (C code): 4 seconds

Time (with assembly multiply): 1.2 seconds

### nRF52

Recently Nordic released their next generation BLE platform. I though it might be interesting to see how well it performs Pairing and Verify. As you can see, this chip is much, much faster:

#### Pairing

Time: 3.7 seconds

#### Verify

Time (with assembly multiply): 0.26 seconds

## Memory

The HomeKit code is approximately 28K (compiled with -Os) and uses 1K of RAM. During Pairing an additional 11K of stack RAM is used.

# Thanks

I want to thank a number of projects which made this possible:

1. https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS - which documents the HomeKit protocols for IP and allowed me to guess how they
were implemented over Bluetooth.

2. http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to - which provides the compact eliptical curve implementations, as well as the sha512 hash.

3. https://tls.mbed.org - which provides the core multi-precission math routines used in the SRP implementation.

4. http://munacl.cryptojedi.org/ - which provides the ARM Cortex-M0 optimized Curve25519 implementation and fast multiply routines.
